Fighting evil by hello, winning love by hello
Never running from a hello, she is the one named hello.

She will never turn her back on her hello.
She is always there to hello.
She is the one in whom we can hello.

She is the one named Sailorrrrrr ...

Sailor hello!
Sailor hello!
Sailor hello!
Sailor hello!

With secret powers all so new to her
She is the one named hello.
